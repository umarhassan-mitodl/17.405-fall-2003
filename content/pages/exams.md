Below is the final exam for the course. Students have the option of taking the exam in place of a long research paper or three short review essays. If the exam is chosen, it is worth 60% of the final course grade, as are the other two options.

Instructions
------------

1.  Please answer three (3) of the following four (4) questions. It is expected that, to the extent relevant, you do **draw heavily** on the readings **across weeks** (as this is a way of ensuring content coverage). Please be sure to note references if or when you draw on readings or on lectures.
2.  Aside from the **reading** time you require to prepare for the actual writing, there is no need to spend more than 3 hours of **writing** per question (this is not a time limit but a suggestion).
3.  Suggestion page coverage - about 3-5 pages per question. Please use this only as very rough guide. You can write as little or as much as you see necessary to convey your points.
4.  Due, one week after Lecture 11.
